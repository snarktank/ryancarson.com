          Over the past two decades, I've worked in the tech industry, starting
          companies, securing investments, and leading teams. One of my proudest
          achievements is founding Treehouse, an online education platform with
          1m+ students learning how to code. This endeavor equipped our students
          with valuable skills and drew an investment of $23 million before its
          acquisition in 2021.
